# Leison Data Training

This repository is a **hands-on data engineering training project** focused on building a clean, reproducible, and version-controlled data workflow using **Git** and **DVC (Data Version Control)**.

The goal of this repo is to practice real-world data management concepts such as:
- Dataset versioning
- Reproducible pipelines
- Collaboration-ready data workflows
- Separation between code and data
